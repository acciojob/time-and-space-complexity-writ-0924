		Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.It explaincs how efficient the code is</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space.</p>
